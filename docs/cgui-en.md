# CGUI Documentation

Introduction
---

CGUI is a GUI framework designed to fit in the needs of creating GUI in Minecraft. Compared to Minecraft's plain widget layout (A list of ``GUIButtons``), CGUI uses position&scale hierarchy, component pattern and dynamic event handlers to describe a GUI. 

CGUI also provides you with a powerful in-game visualized editor, which can greatly change the workflow of GUI creation because artists can get involved. The created GUIs are stored as XML files, and can be de-serialized at runtime to be displayed.

CGUI is already being used in [AcademyCraft](https://github.com/LambdaInnovation/AcademyCraft) to achive some complicated display effects.
